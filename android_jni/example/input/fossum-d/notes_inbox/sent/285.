I noted in the Finance and Accounting report that you guys are setting up a 
meeting with AA to talk about the draft risk management document that folks 
had been working on a year ago.  Please include Tony and I.   We had some 
questions and concerns that I have long since forgotten but will renew and 
talk to you about before the AA meeting.  Thanks. DF
