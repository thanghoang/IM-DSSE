Here's a thought that didn't occur to me when I marked up the mock trial 
script.  Should we have the consultants prominantly feature "IPEC 
Busters"???  Unless we are pretty sure the judge will keep it out on 
relevance grounds, it might be useful to at least get some juror reactions to 
it.  With or without the specific IPEC Busters stuff, we probably ought to 
assume that Jad's theme will be that Northern's whole philosophy was to 
breach contracts without flinching if it served our commercial interests.  
The vitriol from P&P and the other producers plays into that theme.  Maybe we 
ought to spice that part of the script up a bit also just so we can see how 
our response plays.  DF
