Mike, here are two draft sets of talking points covering Stan's initial phone 
call with Ted Davis to discuss whether a settlement meeting would be useful 
and the subsequent settlement meeting itself.  Please give me any comments 
you have and I'll send to Stan or have available to hand to him at our 
meeting, which I understand is scheduled for 9 am on Tuesday.  I'll  be 
calling in from Arizona.  Note there is at least one issue we ought to think 
about a bit more--whether to have Stan imply there may be other goodies 
available other than the Hobbs Line.  I'm inclined to avoid implying that, 
but to have Stan primed to pull out additional goodies if necessary.

I have not yet completed a bullet point outline of the settlement proposal 
for Stan to send to Davis after Stan and he meet.  As things currently stand 
it would basically be identical to the second sheet of talking points.   I 
would prefer to finalize that document after we meet with Stan, both to 
minimize the paper in front of him at the Tuesday meeting and to allow the 
Davis outline to be tailored to reflect the strategy we arrive at with Stan 
(I think I'm safe in assuming we will tinker with the strategy a bit on 
Tuesday morning).  If we do modify the strategy, I'll also modify the talking 
points.  

Britt and Barrett, I wanted you to know the timetable in part because, if 
Stan decides to go forward,  we need to send Barrett's suggested letter to 
Jad verifying continued application of the settlement privilege to Stan and 
Ted's discussions.   I intend to call you after the Stan meeting to advise.  
Just in case you don't hear from me by late morning Tuesday, please give Mike 
a call to confirm whether to send the letter.  I may have fallen into the 
Grand Canyon or been bitten by a hila monster.
