You're right that AA insisted on the reference to it being a sale from 
storage. Remember we are explaining a variance in NET revenues, not GROSS 
revenues. An ordinary sale wouldn't generate enough NET revenue to cause a 
variance that needs to be explained.

Ugh.  Do we need to say "from storage inventory" or can we just mention gas 
sales?  I seem to recall that we already discussed that and the accountants 
wanted to mention the source of the sold gas, but if I'm wrong, lets make the 
reference less specific.  Thanks. DF

Subject: Enron 3rd Qtr 00- 10Q

Here are the paragraphs in the 3QTR 10Q relative to ETS that contain 
references to our base gas sales.  We have suggested the change shown to 
de-emphasize the fact that there were sales in both years.   Do you want to 
suggest any further changes in the next draft we receive for review?
