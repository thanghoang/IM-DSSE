Subject: New 1999 Annual Reports Have Arrived

The new 1999 Annual Reports are now available for distribution.  If you 
haven't already requested books, you may order these through Forms 
Management.  You can either use Moore Source or complete a Forms 
Requisition.  The Item # on the new books is #42990.  Please keep in mind 
that the quantity on these is "per book", not by the box.

If you have questions about how to order, you may contact Micael Shea on
