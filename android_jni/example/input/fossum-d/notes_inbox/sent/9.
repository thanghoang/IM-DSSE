Interesting.  I'll work with MKM and Maria on getting answers to AA's 
questions and comments.  I think we can eliminate the specific cross 
references between the two agreements, but is that the real problem or is AA 
going to choke on our execution of both agreements with the same party?  
(that's a tough one to wire around, if it is their real concern).  Thanks.  DF

Stan, attached is the latest draft of the compression services agreement 
related to the TW compression monetization effort. Since you've reviewed it 
last, nothing material has changed as you can see from the red-lined version. 
We would like to file for regulatory approval soon. Pls let me know if you 
have any questions - thanks.
 
 I'll send the updated PSA agreement in a separate Email.

Attached is a revised redlined draft of the above-referenced  Agreement which 
incorporates comments from regulatory and Mike Bryant with V&E.  We have 
added a new Appendix 1 to cover the Assets subject to this Agreement rather 
than refer to the Exhibit in the Purchase and Sale, as well as an exclusivity 
provision regarding use of the Assets.  We've also added a reference to the 
arbitration section in the event the oversight committee cannot agree to 
changes necessary or desirable to the assets.
