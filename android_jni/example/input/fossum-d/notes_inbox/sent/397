Attached for your review and comment is a draft of a policy to be distributed 
to EOL/ENA employees. While the policy may seem over-restrictive, the fact 
basis upon which the policy is based is that the activities identified in the 
policy are currently performed by ENA employees. Of course, we still need to 
talk about this issue.
