As winter approaches and the possibility of inclement weather, I want to 
remind you of the process we have in place to notify you if the office will 
be closed or have a delayed start.

You are encouraged to call 398-7000, 398-7200 or 398-7700 for an announcement 
regarding the closing of the office.  Every attempt will be made to have this 
announcement in place no later than 6:30 AM.  

We will also attempt to contact the following radio stations:

  KFAB   1110 AM
  KKAR  1290 AM
  KQKQ             98 FM

to have them broadcast an announcement.  As you are probably aware, we have 
experienced difficulty reaching the radio stations in the past so please call 
one of the numbers listed above if you don't hear an announcement on the 
radio.
