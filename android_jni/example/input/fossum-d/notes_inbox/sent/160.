Subject: EnronOnline

Attached is a brief overview of the proposed TW Pilot Program for 20/d of 
firm capacity using EnronOnline as the Internet Tool.  This is the 
information that Steve Harris has been working on.  Unfortunately, Steve 
Hotte and I have a conflict with the meeting you scheduled on Thursday May 4 
at 1:00.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,
Ricki Winters for Julia White
