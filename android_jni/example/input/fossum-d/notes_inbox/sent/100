Bob, Steve Gilbert was not working on this, but he thought that the numbers 
in 10ks and annual reports generally get filled in by Elaine Concklin or 
someone based on ET&S numbers fed up throught the system by Gilbert's group.  
For now, I'm leaving the blanks in this draft blank and explaining to Moran 
that I have limited our review to the legal and regulatory verbiage.  
Thanks.  DF

Emily Sellers asked that I email the draft of the 10-K to you.  It is in 5 
sections because we will eventually fold in the financials and the management 
discussion pages.
