Mike,

Finally talked to Steve Winston.  Oneok will meet with us in Omaha on the 
afternoon of Monday November 20th.  They will bring representatives from 
Business Development, Engineering, and Operations but no attorney's.  The 
meeting will be limited to CO2 mitigation.  They would like us to provide 
them with:  1) all facility or operational alternatives that we have or would 
considered including their cost, and what we would charge to provide them as 
a service,  and 2) any contractual or tariff actions we could take (like 
getting the CIG gas receipt moved to Dumas). 

Steve indicated that Prax Air (s.p.?) is challenging Oneok's "force majeure" 
contention and is holding Oneok accountable for nonperformance.  Steve will 
fax me a copy of the notice they received if Oneok's attorney's approve.  
Steve also indicated that since the CO2 level has come down this month, they 
will try to put the Helium plant back on today.

Charlie
