Drew - 

Attached are the latest drafts of the Northern and Transwestern budget 
templates for your review and comment.  Changes were made to legal fees for 
both cost centers as per my notes from the last group meeting we had on 
budget.  In addition, you should have received the latest consolidated budget 
run and the latest outside counsel spreadsheet for 2001.

Let me know if you have any questions, modifications, concerns, etc.

Eric
