Subject: TW Capacity Auction Timeline

Attached below is a proposed timeline for activities and deadlines for 
completion of such activities associated with the upcoming TW auction on 
EnronOnline. The timeline is set in order to meet the July 1 deadline for 
implementation. We have tried to structure the activities and deadlines so 
that it can be adapted to other GPG auctions as well. I appreciate everyone's 
help in advance in meeting these dates which I certainly realize are tight 
but are necessary in order to meet the July target. The key activities which 
are critical for completion for the week of May 15 are as follows:

1.Webtext for TW Auction----Finalized by Monday May 15 (to be handed off to 
EOL for auction site design). 
2.Draft Customer Letter announcing auction out for internal comments by 
Wednesday May 17.

In addition, a GPG distribution list for review of certain activities (i.e., 
customer letter, internal employee announcement, press release) has been 
included. We will  update this timeline once a week. If you have questions, 
please call.

THANKS for everyone's help in moving us along so quickly so far!!! We will be 
able to meet the July goal!!!

Julia



Thank you,
