from all over the world!  And those ideas aren't just sitting there -- oh,

happening at the ThinkBank.

Did you ask a question at the all-employee meeting last month that was not 
answered?  Take a look in eMeet.  We've posted responses to questions from 
the meeting, as well as another anonymous question to the Office of the 
Chairman.  See the "Office of the Chairman" category in eMeet.


Stop by the eSpeak Archives to see what was discussed in Cindy Olson's 
EnronOptions event.  Great questions, great answers.  They're all in the 
transcript on eSpeak.
