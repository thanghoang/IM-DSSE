Subject: Important Bar News concerning your Dues Invoice


This is an official Bar announcement for the purpose of disseminating 
important Bar news.
-------------------------------------------------
Attention Bar Members:

The Annual Registration and Dues Statement for the 2000--2001 dues year were
recently mailed.

In accordance with the Rules and By-laws, the due and payable date is July
1, 2000.  The statements also reflect a "billing" date of May 7, 2000.

Due to a computer problem with our new software, the billing extract was
produced on May 7, 2000 but was unable to completely print until early June.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused in our members
trying to comply with the due date.

Here are the important dates regarding dues payments for this year:.

July 1   -  due and payable

August 1  - reminder notice to all unpaid members

September 1 - Final notice mailed by certified mail to all unpaid members
with a $30.00 late charge added

October 31, 2000 - Automatic suspension occurs unless dues and late charges
are post-marked by this date

------------------------------------------------
