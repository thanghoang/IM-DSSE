Subject: FERC interviews in Omaha

Today, I received a data request (attached) which provides more specifics on 
the interviews to be conducted in Omaha. Please note that they have asked to 
meet with Keith Petersen and Ray Smith on an individual basis.  If the FERC 
deems it necessary, they will interview individuals that report to them.
