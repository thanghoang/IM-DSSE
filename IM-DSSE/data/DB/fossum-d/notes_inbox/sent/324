***Viking Days 2000 - Thanks for Coming Home!:
October 6-8 was quite the weekend for Augustana.  It began with the
inauguration of Dr. Bruce Halverson '66 as Augustana's 22nd
President.  Cold weather didn't keep alumni away from the parade. And the
football game against NDSU was a good fight.  We inducted the Class of
1950 into the Honor Guard at the Heritage Honor Luncheon and honored
outstanding individuals at the Athletic Hall of Fame Banquet on Friday
night and at the Alumni Banquet on Saturday night.  Viking Varieties was a
hit in the Sioux Falls Arena and the crowd was great at the Afterglow,
complete with music by President Halverson and the Fabulous Jadesmen and
Doc Krueger and the Alumni Brass Choir.  Click on
http://www.augie.edu/alumni/homecoming.html for pictures from the
weekend.  Class pictures can be found at the "Reunions Site" under each
class year. Plan now to attend Viking Days 2001, October 5-7.  The Classes
of 1936, 1941, 1946, 1951, 1956, 1961, 1966, 1971, 1976, 1981, 1986, 1991,
and 1996 will celebrate reunions.
