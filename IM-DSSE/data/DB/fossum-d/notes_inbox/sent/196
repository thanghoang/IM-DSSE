This is a problem your people should be aware of because I think our usual 
practice when we want to verify ownership structure is to call the corporate 
secretary's office.  If they are behind, I don't know who we should go to in 
the future.  Maybe we need to run everything by corp. tax from now on.  Ugh.

Subject: Corporate Secretary's Data Sheets

The erroneous statements found in the Form 2 related to Transwestern today 
are traceable in part to the fact that the Corporate Secretary's Data Sheets 
are months behind in their accuracy.  This is not the first instance where 
serious and costly errors have been made by persons who were relying on the 
data sheets for accurate ownership information on Enron Corp. subsidiaries.

If you have any creative ideas on finding a remedy for the extremely long lag 
time between the submission of final documentation to the Corporate Secretary 
and the updating of the sheets, please let me know.  In the meantime, be 
aware that the information is not necessarily reliable.

Thanks

Alicia
