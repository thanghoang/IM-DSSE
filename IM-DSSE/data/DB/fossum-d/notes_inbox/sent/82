The following is a memo from accounting containing some new accounting codes 
you should be aware of.  I should warn you that your timesheets must be 
approved by your supervisor; therefore, Code 5604 should not be used.  


 
It has come to our attention recently that many  of you have been turning
in timesheets that specify large amounts of  "Miscellaneous? Unproductive
Time" (Code 5309). To our  department, unproductive time isn't a problem.
What is a problem, however, is  not knowing exactly what you are doing
during your unproductive time.  Attached below is a sheet specifying a
tentative extended job code list based  on our observations of employee
activities. 

The list will allow you  to specify with a fair amount of precision what
you are doing during your  unproductive time. Please begin using this job
code list immediately and let  us know about any difficulties you
encounter. 

Thank  you,
Accounting.
