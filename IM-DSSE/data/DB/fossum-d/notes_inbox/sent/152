I had an interesting conversation with Mark Courtney today, this time about 
something that doesn't cost us money.  He has gained a good bit of experience 
on transmission availability in NW New Mexico from the Gallup electric 
contract negotiation.  His take on transmission constraints is consistent 
with what Kevin and I had suspected:  Alb. is a load pocket and the 
prevailing flow is west to east into Alb.  Constraints only affect west to 
east flows and a generator in Alb. could always move power to four corners by 
displacement.  Courtney has worked with an ENA transmission guy named Steve 
Walton who apparently has more experience with the 230Kv transmission lines 
that had the problem that led to the recent blackouts in Alb.  If we are not 
talking to him already, he would be another guy worth talking to.
