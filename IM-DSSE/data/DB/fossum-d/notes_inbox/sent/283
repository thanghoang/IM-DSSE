Here's the deal--I just talked to my guy out in Kennebec S.D. and got a 
glowing report on the situation.  His opening day group is down to 6 guys so 
he is only giving them access to half of his fields--we get first shot at the 
rest.  He's got so many pheasants he's worried about us limiting out to fast 
and getting mad.    I assured him that the way we all shoot that wouldn't be 
a problem.  
When:  Friday-Sunday, Oct. 27-29.  
Where:  Kenebec S.D.  (about 2 hours east of Rapid City, about 5 hours from 
Omaha)
$$:   $75 per guy per day if we have at least 8 guys.   If we dwindle to less 
than 8, its $100 per guy.  (he will cut us some slack on this if some of you 
can only hunt 2 days.)
Fish:  Walleye fish fry on Sat. PM included
Lodging :  Super 8 in Chamberlain--about 30 miles away if the weather is 
cold, possible camping in Kennebec if people are up for it.  Super 8 is a 
lovely place:  motto is "Labs sleep free."  $100 per night, 4 guys per room+ 
$25/head/night.

So far, I think we've got 5 or 6 guys locked in solid. Another 6 or 8 have 
been invited but are obtaining spousal consent.   I'd like to get 10 locked 
in solid by end of Sept.  More than that would make the hunting a little 
clumsy.  Bay, my wife says you can't come because your new kid is due around 
this time.  What a lame excuse!!  You were there for the first 4, right?  
Doesn't a guy deserve a bye eventually?  If you guys have anyone else that's 
interested other than the folks that have already been invited, let me know 
as we may want to invite a few more just to make sure we have around 10.  
Talk to you.  DF
