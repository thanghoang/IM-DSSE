NNG and TW. Call with any questions.

Thanks. Julia

Subject: FYI - Top Ten Revenues

My group is frequently asked to provide the top ten or twenty five customers 
(based on revenues) on our pipelines.   Attached are two files that we just 
provided to general accounting based on 1999 revenues.  If you recall being 
asked these questions, you may want to print off the attached spreadsheets or 
save this lotus note to a file for future reference.

Rick
