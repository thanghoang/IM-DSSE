Got a call from Dennis out of the blue this afternoon.  He's pretty gung ho, 
and also alluded to several other projects he's got on the front burner 
(gas-fired power deals).  He had met again with some DOE folks in DC about 
the power contract and feels it is 70-80% locked in.  Have you ever known a 
project developer who would admit to less than 70-80% odds???  I look forward 
to talking on Tuesday.  DF
