Thanks for the tip last night!  I called and ragged around my thieving ins. 
company this morning and they are going to cough up some serious insurance 
for me and Sandra at suuper-cheap pre XXX prices.  Cool.  My only concern at 
this point is that my over-insured status may create undesirable incentives 
for the little ladies in my life (the dreaded "worth more dead than alive 
syndrome"!)  Adios amigo!  DF
