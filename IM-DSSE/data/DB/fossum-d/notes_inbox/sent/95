Subject: 1999 Mastio Review


As you all know we have received detail information supporting the ET&S 
rating out of 50 companies, and we have been analyzing such information in 
preparation for a review with Stan and his direct reports by mid March.  I 
have been discussing our preliminary results with various different groups 
within ET&S and need to also get your input. Therefore, I have set up a 
meeting on Tuesday March 7th at 1:30 p.m. in EB49C2, to review our 
preliminary findings. The goal of this meeting is to review the data we have 
received from the focus group of ET&S customers, and to discuss such results 
from the standpoint of 5 areas we can focus on for improvement both short and 
long term.  Please be expecting a draft of the results from Tammy Lee-Jaquet, 
by close of business this Friday to allow time for review prior to this 
meeting. 

Thank you,
Ricki
