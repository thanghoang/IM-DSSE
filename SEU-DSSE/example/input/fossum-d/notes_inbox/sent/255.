Whaaasssssuuup.  Sack--you need to update me on where the hell you are these 
days.  Flying jets in Denver?  Chicago?  Where?  Reed, you need to check your 
emails more than once every 6 months.  Huet, I'll call you on the apple data 
tonight or tomorrow.   Loon, since I sent you a cool email, you need to 
invite me to at least one boondoggle on Wednesday (Dougie is going to the 
Fascist convention in Philadelphia all next week to schmooze).  Carmany, you 
are just weak--you need a wife and about 7 kids to throttle your lifestyle 
back a bit.  Egg and Kate--I have nothing mean to say to you just now, but 
I'll work on it.  DF
