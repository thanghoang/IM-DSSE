These guys don't give up.  I'll forward any information Tino gives me on 
their latest DOE strategy.  Rockey--do you have any interest in following up 
on Tino's Wichita project??  I don't know how far it is from any of our 
lines, but it may be worth a chat.  DF

Sorry you are feedling bad. Hope reading email doesn't hurt. I'll try and be 
brief. 
1. We have an opportunity to acquire a? 35MW? cogeneration facility in Kansas 
that is from the early 1980's and rarely used. We may want to talk about a? 
joint project. Can I borrow some expertise via a phone call fom you to your 
electric gurus to let me know what the spot market into KC and Wichita looks 
like.

2. I met with DML and we intend to propose a deal that has us charging only 
for the generation and for DOE to assumme the risk and or reward of the cost 
of gas.Before you have any conversations with Dennis or your folks give me a 
call so we can flesh this out. We have DOE meetings scheduled for 7/24-25th 
so it is a busy month. Our consultant's are reviewing the DOE data we? 
received. I''l let you? know what we learn.They may have a bigger steam load 
than I would have guessed.
