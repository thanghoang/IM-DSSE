Yeah--EMC is the best investment I ever made--I only wish I had put in 
100000k instead of 1k.  Check this email out--one of our guys got it from 
someone at one of our competitors.  Enron is known as the "evil empire" in 
the energy bidness.  DF

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement
said to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion.  In the deal, Enron will
provide both gas and electric commodities to Hades' facilities throughout
and under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former CEO of energy
monopolist
Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy management division.  Said
Rockefeller, "Obviously Hell has significant heating demands.  While eternal
flames are a great idea in concept, they require vast and reliable fuel
resources.  Enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my
boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just
like the way they do business."  A spokesperson for Enron said the two
cultures were able to work easily together during negotiations.  According
to the company, "The deal fits both companies exceptionally well.  With
Hades' ability to attract and retain new customers, we see this as a
fabulous
growth opportunity for millennia to come."  According to several energy
industry insiders, Hades' high heating demand with very little need for
summer air conditioning make it a very attractive energy portfolio addition.
Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide
and approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained
high growth rates over the last two thousand years.  Enron is one of the
world's leading energy and communications companies.  The company owns
approximately $37 billion in energy and communications assets.  Enron
ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's "Best 100 Companies to Work For
if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A Week," and
is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked by customers
with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply contracts.
