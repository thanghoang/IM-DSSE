Drew;
I've been working with Jeff Fawcett on two projects.
Two clients are involved.
I've heard nothing from TW on either.? One project (Wikieup, AZ) is  hot to 
go.
Can you kick this guy for me (and TW)?
I've been calling JF with?no response.
Let me know if I can assist you in any way.
Best regards,
GB
