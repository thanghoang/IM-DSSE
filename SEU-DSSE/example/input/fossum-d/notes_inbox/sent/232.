Thinking about bailing out of the big O for a couple of days w/o rugrats or 
Sandra. Taking Kari out of her native biome is more hassle than its worth 
these days.  Might just blow up for a long weekend and do some fishing and 
beer drinking.  Send me the name of that book on flyfishing in the Hills--I 
want to see if I can get it on Amazon.   AMFDJF
