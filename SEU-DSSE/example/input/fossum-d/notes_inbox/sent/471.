EHS Corporate has asked we verify this inventory of services/products  from 
all of the various companies that fit under the very broadest form of the ETS 
umbrella.  I offer the following thoughts:  I don't believe EOTT has any 
relationship with the Mt. Belvieu storage operations; I don't know if we 
purchase natural gas except for fuel purposes; do we currently have any gas 
gathering facilities?? or just transmission??; EOTT Fleet Vehicles could be 
better defined; Risk Management services??

Feedback would be extremely helpful before the 17th

Lou,

This is a follow-up to a meeting we had about 2 months ago on Life Cycle 
Impact Assessments.  The 1st phase of the assessment involves completing an 
inventory of Enron's products\services and volumes.  I am currently 
requesting each business unit to verify the products and services we have 
identified and make any modifications to the list.  I am enlisting your 
assistance to do this for ETS, including EOTT.  I need to have the 
verification completed by 11/17. Please advise if you have any questions.



Thanks,
Susan Worthen
