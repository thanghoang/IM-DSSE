Subject: Electric Developments

When we originally decided to use my staff meetings for "graduate education" 
one of the hot topics was the electric industry.  We all had a first lesson 
on this topic in Shelley's electricity seminar last summer.  Now, John and 
Kevin have graciously agreed to join us Tuesday at 1:30 to discuss recent 
developments in electric markets and NN's and TW's efforts to attract power 
generation load to the system.  Specific topics I hope to cover include the 
following:
1.  What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer 
puts his plant?  
2.  Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various 
utilities/power pools vary all that much or are Order 888 tariffs pretty much 
the same all over? 
3.  How do IPPs decide what fuel supply strategy works best (i.e., buy 
bundled delivered fuel from someone vs. buy gas, storage, transport, etc.  
separately)?
4.  What is the RTO Rule and why should we care? 
5.  Has $5/mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market?
 Depending on how deeply we get into these topics, we may need to schedule a 
follow-up session at a later date.  I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.
