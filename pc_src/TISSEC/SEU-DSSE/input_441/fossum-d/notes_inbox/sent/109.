Subject: Project EWE ll - possible joint bid

It it becomes desirable to structure the Reliant deal off balance sheet, we 
would most likely need a partner, either an industry participant or a 
financial entity.  Some potential industry partners might include Nisource, 
Utilicorp, or Oneok.  (are there others?)  

According to the press, Nisource will need to pay down debt following the 
Columbia merger.  However they have a continuing strategic appetite for LDC 
assets.  They are/will be a registered Utility Holding Company, so obviously 
PUHCA poses no concern for them.  

Here is a possible structure for an Enron/Nisource JV purchase of the Reliant 
package.  Other Nisource and /or Columbia assets could be added to the 
transaction to generate net excess cash for Nisource (presumeably only if ENE 
had a strategic interest in the added assets).

Comments please.
