That was an interesting little conversation.  I came back down and looked for 
you guys but you had both split.  We should take a few minutes and plug John 
in on what happened at the end of that meeting when the power issues came 
up.  I'm somewhat surprised at Bill's reaction, but what the hell, now we can 
run with Cunningham, and we know MKM's pulse on Hubbard (and Bill's).  Pretty 
damn good end to the week, all things considered.  DF
