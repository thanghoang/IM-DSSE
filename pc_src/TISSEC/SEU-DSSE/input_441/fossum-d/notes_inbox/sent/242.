Subject: GPG Organization Announcement

ATTACHED IS AN IMPORTANT ORGANIZATION ANNOUNCEMENT THAT SHOULD GO OUT TO ALL 
GPG EMPLOYEES IMMEDIATELY:

The timeliness and confidentiality of this announcement have made it 
impossible for us to use the Notes Team to handle distribution via e-mail, as 
would normally be the case.  As a result, please forward the message to 
everyone in your respective department(s).

Note to those of you whose departments include field locations:  We are 
sending the announcement to all field locations via burst FAX, so you should 
not need to e-mail copies.  Faxes will be distributed at approximately 10:30 
this morning.

Please call Lisa Costello (x31819) if you have any questions.
