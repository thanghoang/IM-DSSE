     Most people are surprised when we tell them, for instance, that 
California state case law back to 1934 is available online for free - 
including the official West citation and pagination. If this is news to you, 
what else should you know about online legal research? The world isn't 
changing, it has changed. What about you?

     Today, as our clients in some of this nation's leading firms and Fortune 
500 companies already know, TheLaw.net Pro Custom Web Browser provides 
unlimited access to our proprietary, searchable database of more than 4 
million cases that includes:

--Nearly 200 Federal and state appellate jurisdictions (listed in detail 
below with date of origin)
--There are no passwords, meters, slices, printing, downloading, viewing or 
transaction hassles to contend with
--Many jurisdictions are back-filed to the early 20th century, all are 
updated daily
--The official citations are included shortly after they become available
--Search syntax options include natural language, Boolean, truncation and 
nesting
--You can easily research the history of a cite or simply pop-up a case if 
you know: party, counsel, court, date, docket number, citation, panel or 
author
--$995 buys five individual unlimited access via our Workgroup Edition
--Individual subscriptions are just $345 for our Convenience Edition and the 
software resides on your PC at work, home and on the road (See below for more 
information regarding applicable November discounts, volume licensing and 
special incentives for AALL and ACCA Members)


ASK YOURSELF THIS:
     If the present and future of case law, statutes, rules, forms, 
administrative codes, executive agency databases, legislation trackers, law 
reviews and corporate and personal profile information is free, what 
processes and standards do you have in place for quickly accessing and 
leveraging these resources on behalf of your practice? In the absence of any 
best practices how can you ever expect to meaningfully shorten the checklist 
of enhanced, premium-wine products you may still need from the big two 
compusearchers?


REAL LEGAL RESEARCH FROM WORK, HOME OR THE ROAD
     TheLaw.net's foolproof custom browser is a plug and play software 
solution that facilitates real legal research for all attorneys, paralegals 
and librarians. Besides case law, our slick software includes a built-in, 
deep-linked, point and click menu driven system for quickly popping-up any of 
the 50,000 best, most frequently sought after web based documents and 
databases, such as:
