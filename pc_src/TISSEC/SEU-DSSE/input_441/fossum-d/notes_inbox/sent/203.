It's against my nature, but I'm getting pretty close to giving up.  Attached 
is a draft letter to Langley punting the project.  I've tried to sugar coat 
it as much as possible so he doesn't get pissed off and automatically go to 
El Paso if he does somehow get the project built.  The letter is based on the 
assumption that we will call them first to explain where we are.   Also, I've 
assumed that we won't send Dennis any of the data from EE&CC or ENA.  I think 
we can chat generally on the phone and give them the ballpark results without 
actually sending the schedules to him.  Please give me a call so we can help 
Steve with his script for when he calls Langley.  (did you notice how I 
disappear when things start to go south?)  Talk to you soon.  DF
