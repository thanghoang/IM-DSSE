I have been having trouble with my email, but it's back on line.? Have  you 
gotten my phone messages regarding the meeting with Murray Fogler?? It  went 
well, and he has?agreed that if we can't find an easy solution to the  
issues, he will support me in court on the motion to transfer the case to  
Houston.? At my suggestion, he will also ask Duke about the possibility  
of?their participation in a quick mediation or binding arbitration, and  will 
make contact (he says he has had none up to now) with counsel for Chisos to  
take their temperature on these and all other issues.
?
In the meantime, he will (at his own prompting) consider the last paragraph  
of my original letter as our settlement offer and come back with an 
"official"  response.? I will let you know as soon as?I hear something.
