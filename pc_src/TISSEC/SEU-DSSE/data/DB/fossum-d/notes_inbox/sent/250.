Tino, attached is a spreadsheet with the info I think you need.  I got the 
publication wrong--its "Megawatt Daily" that posts daily prices.  Hope this 
is helpful.  DF 

Drew,

Attached is an excel file which contains pricing for the following delivery 
points January 1, 1999 through 
April 30, 2000:

 Four Corners
 Palo Verde
 Mead Nevada
 Southwest Power Pool

Let me know if you want any additional information.  We can get April 30, 
2000 to present information.  I just
have to call RDI--they put it out by quarter so at the end of July we will 
get the next disk.  They'll send me the
data if we need it.

Lorna
