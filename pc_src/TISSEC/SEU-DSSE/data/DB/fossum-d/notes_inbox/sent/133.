I may have these at home, but just to be sure, please email me your H and W 
and Cell ph. #, pager #, palm pilot #, the # that connects to the steel plate 
in your head, your address, and any other communication coordinates you think 
I need to have.  I'll be at the Westin La Something in San Anton, checking 
out Friday, and cell # 402-630-8461.  I'll give you guys a call at one of 
your numbers at a time of your choosing on Friday PM, and then head over to 
your joint or a restaurant or something for festivities.   I may even call 
you today if I can get a few minutes away from the madness.  

I'm looking forward to reminding you about all of the fun things that come 
with working for corporate america.  You're gonna have to start reading 
Dilbert again so you can relate to all of us other corporate drones.  Adios, 
DF
