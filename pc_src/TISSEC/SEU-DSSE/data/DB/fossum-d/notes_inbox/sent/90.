Enron Not Looking for New Business M&A in 2000

    Enron does not expect any mergers or acquisitions of new business and i=
s
not interested in selling its pipelines. Enron will seek opportunities to
fill-in its businesses with asset purchases, rather  than purchasing new
businesses. It will be giving a detailed view of its telecommunications
business at an analysts meeting in Houston today. Enron says Europe, Latin
America=01,s southern cone and Japan provide great opportunity. Enron=01,s =
EnCom
unit=01,s recently teamed with the Japanese firm Orix to participate in the
retail electricity sales business when the Japan market is opened, currentl=
y
scheduled for this March. Enron plans to use EnronOnline as its vehicle to
enter the European market. EnronOnline, the global Internet-based transacti=
on
system for wholesale energy and other commodities, will soon allow it to
reduce back-office costs in a transaction substantially. In addition to bei=
ng
able to cut the $1,000-$1,500 per transaction as much as 80-90%, EnronOnlin=
e
will create an environment where a buyer or seller of natural gas or power
will be able to more easily, with a computer mouse click, process complex
power and natural gas transactions.
