Subject: INGAA slides for Larcamp Meeting

Attached are the slides that Lorraine Cross plans to use to kick off the Feb. 
10 meeting with Larcamp.  I have a conference call with Lorraine tomorrow at 
10 am to discuss the Larcamp meeting.  Let me know if you see anything 
troubling with the slides.




MK - I thought these statistic might be helpful background for your 
presentation as well.
