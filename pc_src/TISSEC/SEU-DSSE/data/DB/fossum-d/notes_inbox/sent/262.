Subject: Power Point Presentation


Here is Mark Haedicke's eCommerce powerpoint presentation which he will make 
next Friday at the Energy Bar Luncheon.  It look's like it will be VERY 
good.  If you do not have a form to submit your reservations, let me know and 
I will have Janet make you a copy.  The deadline is next Tuesday.
